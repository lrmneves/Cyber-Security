Assignment 1 - Big Data Analytics

Dataset: Cyber Security

For this assignment, I have first clustered the attack_categories as described next. Then, I have calculated a correlation matrix between all features on each dataset and filtered some features that were
extremely correlated to each other, changing the labels so we know which features are being represented by that feature alone. Then, I have mapped features on both datasets so we do not have repeated information on two columns, converting them to the same format as needed. After that, I have put both datasets together, inserting a NaN value for missing values.

For the attack_cat labels, I have mapped all the labels on both datasets to 5 labels: normal, dos, r2l, u2r and probe, as it is stated on the kdd attack_types file. For the UNSW dataset, I have manually mapped all the attack categories to one of the 5 labels and added a generic label that is only on this dataset, as I didn't have enough information to cluster it onto the other 5 labels. 
Column label is a binary label, 0 for normal and 1 for attacks.
